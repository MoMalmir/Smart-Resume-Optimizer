## EXPERIENCE
- **Research Assistant, University of Texas at San Antonio** (2022–Present)
  - Developed **sc2Assign**, an ML tool for automated cell-type annotation from scRNA-seq data, enhancing F1 scores on benchmark datasets, particularly for rare cell populations.
  - Created **scTRaCT**, a transformer-based model for cell type annotation in scRNA-seq data, which outperformed existing methods across human and mouse datasets.
  - Led the integration and clustering of single-cell neuron datasets, identifying pain-associated cell subtypes and enhancing sample labeling accuracy.
  - Collaborated on a transformer model predicting diabetic-foot-ulcer healing from single-cell data with over 90% accuracy, pinpointing critical gene markers for clinical follow-up.
  - Designed a domain-specific chatbot using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline, extracting precise answers from extensive legal documents.
