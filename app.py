Your objective is to generate a compelling, professional, one-page resume in Markdown format, tailored to the provided job description. This resume will be converted directly to PDF, so it must be clean, structured, and formatted strictly in Markdown.
If the resume contains tools, frameworks, or skills not mentioned in the job description, replace them with similar or more relevant ones only if they are logically equivalent. For example, replace ‚ÄúTableau‚Äù with ‚ÄúPowerBI‚Äù if PowerBI is mentioned in the job description. Do not replace if the substitution is not ethically or professionally accurate.
Goal:
Generate a resume that:
Highlights measurable achievements (use the XYZ format: Accomplished X, measured by Y, by doing Z),
Prioritize listing projects from most relevant to least relevant based on the job description.
Briefly mention the tools used and skills developed in each project if relevant, 
Identify and prioritize keywords and skills (hard and soft) in the job description,
Do not invent or add any projects, skills, tools, courses, or experiences that do not exist in the original resume. Only use content from the provided resume. Be strictly truthful and ethical
If possible, while staying honest, incorporate as many relevant keywords from the job description as you can to optimize the resume for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).
Includes all specified sections with bullet points where appropriate,
Follows consistent and professional formatting,
Uses Markdown section headers and bullet points,
Avoid generic or vague claims.
Include only the most relevant projects and publications based on the job description.
Remove any projects that are not closely aligned with the target role or do not showcase relevant skills.
Select and list only the top 1‚Äì2 publications that best support the role, focusing on research areas, tools, or methods that match the job description.
Instructions:
Do not include triple backticks, YAML blocks, or any explanations. Only output the Markdown-formatted resume.
Use markdown-style section headers like ## SUMMARY, ## EXPERIENCE, etc.
Separate each section with a line (‚Äî-).
Use bullet points for EXPERIENCE, TECHNICAL SKILLS, PUBLICATIONS, RELATED COURSES, and LEADERSHIP & MENTORSHIP.
Keep total content to about 400‚Äì500 words (1 page).
Write in third-person, professional tone. No first-person pronouns or buzzwords.
Use strong action verbs (e.g., Led, Built, Reduced, Optimized).
Include at least five quantified achievements.
Ensure content flows logically and supports job relevance.
Additional Instructions:
Do not include SUMMARY
Format the ## EDUCATION section to minimize space, following this layout:

- University of Texas at San Antonio, PhD Electrical and Computer Engineering | 2022‚ÄìPresent
- Tarbiat Modares University, MS Electrical and Computer Engineering | 2013‚Äì2016
- Enghelab Eslami Technical University, BS Electrical Engineering | 2009‚Äì2013 

‚Äã
Sections to Include (mandatory, even if one or two are empty ‚Äî include placeholder content if necessary),
Header section (mandetory): 
Extract the name, email, phone number, location, and links (LinkedIn, GitHub, Google Scholar) from the original resume.
At the very top middle of the Markdown output, include them in this exact format:
‚Äù
# **Mostafa Malmir** (bring the name to the middle of the page)
malmir.edumail@gmail.com | (210) 350‚Äì9263 | San Antonio, TX | [LinkedIn.com](https://linkedin.com/in/mostafa-malmir) | [GitHub.com](https://github.com/momalmir) | [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GZ4wP8YAAAAJ&hl=en)‚Äù
*Do not separate continue on the SUMMARY section*
SUMMARY
seperate with a line 
EXPERIENCE
seperate with a line 
TECHNICAL SKILLS
seperate with a line 
EDUCATION
seperate with a line 
RELATED COURSES AND CERTIFICATES
(**separate the items in this section with | or a small black circles in inline do not make bullet points**)
seperate with a line 
SELECTED PUBLICATIONS
seperate with a line 
LEADERSHIP AND MENTORSHIP
Formatting Reminders:
Do not use LaTeX formatting, tables, or HTML.
Ensure all bullet lists are clean -Item.
Minimize vertical space between sections and bullet points to maximize content on a single page.
Do not add extra blank lines between bullets or section headers unless necessary for clarity.
Make sure no section is skipped, even if it's empty ‚Äî use "N/A" or a single bullet like Available upon request.
Output Format:
Just the formatted resume in Markdown with clean headers and bullet points ‚Äî no extra text or formatting artifacts.
